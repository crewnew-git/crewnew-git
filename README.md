# ðŸš€ About me & my involvements / availability

With over two and a half decades of expertise in the realm of software development, I have honed my skills as a developer, software analyst, development team leader, teacher in IT school, and software project manager. My extensive experience includes a strong focus on crafting the most effective architecture and wireframing solutions. Currently, I am dedicating half of my time to own exciting startup (Klarity), leaving ample opportunity for me to serve your needs. I'm available to hire as a freelancer through CrewNew or I can also become your half-time employee.

As a fervent technology enthusiast, I am passionate about researching, developing, and discussing the most innovative approaches to ensure rapid, secure, and bug-free delivery. My writing credits include a book on backend development for Packt Publishing https://crnw.uk/hasurali as well as a piece on the remarkable low-code admin panel builder, Directus https://crnw.uk/directus

I would be delighted to arrange a 15-30 minute chat, where we can delve into topics such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), pair programming, [Agile methodologies](https://crnw.uk/agile), code quality, and more. By employing the finest stack and techniques, I am confident in my ability to provide you with a backend, API, and user admin panel functionalities that are up to 10 times faster for your ultimate product.

## Klarity

[Klarity.app is an automatic time-tracking solution](https://klarity.app) that is ideal for remote or on-site developers and other professionals working with computers and smartphones. It fully automates time tracking, so users don't have to spend any time on reporting. Klarity tracks time automatically by reading and understanding documents the same way a human reviewer would, and then pre-populating the review checklist.
